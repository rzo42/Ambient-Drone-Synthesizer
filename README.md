# Ambient-Drone-Synthesizer
Arduino based ambient drone Synthesizer with noise depth, color and density controls. 4 bit amplitude modulation with shape and speed controls.

It is simple to build, requires few componants and is alot of fun to play with.

Parts:  
        
        1 Arduino (designed for a nano clone but it chould work with amost arduino boards)

        6 10k potentiometers
        
        5 1k resistors
        
        3 470 nf resistors
        
        1 100 nf capacitor
        
        1 22 uf capacitor
